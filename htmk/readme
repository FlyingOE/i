http server

build
$sh mk

use
$htmk a.k b.k

k runs inside an http server.
the server sends local files from the current directory
and handles special requests from k.

k programs are given on the command line.
they can register http routes using 5 builtins:

  get put post patch delete

example
get["/table/t";{x;"<tr>..</tr>"}]

these builtins receive 2 arguments: an url pattern and a callback function.
the k function receives the requests body as input x and returns chars.

queries
the url pattern may contain a query definition:

  "/a/b/c?q=i&u=f&w=s"

the queries of requests to /a/b/c are parsed and converted to k vars
of the registered type: i f s c (int float symbol chars).
for the callback function they are available as globals.

all requests that do not match any registered pattern are handled as file
server requests.

extra builtins

 png x  /convert list of ints to png bytes, e.g. png 800^(800*600)?256^3
