http server

build
$sh mk dep

use
$htmk
$htmk :1234  #runs on http://localhost:1234

k runs inside an http server.
the server sends local files from the current directory
and handles special requests from k.

all k programs in the current directory are executed on startup.
they can register http routes using the url builtin.

example
 url["/table/t";{x;"<tr>..</tr>"}]

 url[p;f] registers a path-pattern and a callback function.
the k function receives the requests body as input x and returns chars.

queries
the url pattern may contain a query definition:

 "/a/b/c?q=i&u=f&w=s"

the queries of requests to /a/b/c are parsed and converted to k vars
of the registered type: i f s c (int float symbol chars).
for the callback function they are available as globals.

all requests that do not match any registered pattern are handled as file
server requests.
