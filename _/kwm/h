memory filesystem (.fs) <- drop files into the window
 \lf     (list files, access with io verbs)
 \l file (load file k source)
 \w file (download file)
 \ws     (download workspace k.ws)
 \e file (edit ESC to write)
 drop "*.ws" exchanges k memory

terminal
 return executes current line (anywhere) or selected text(e.g. multiline)
 esc    toggles hold mode (disable execution) and remove canvas
 \c (clear) reset textarea

draw  (w 9:x)
 (2/w) 9:(4/w*h) rand 255*256
 w and h are predefined with window size at page load
interactive ui (canvas)
 .m mouse callback
 .k key callback (click to focus)

animate 
 \L 500   (ms delay)                             /nyi
 \L expr  Loop k executing until ESC is pressed  /nyi
